=====================

This is a thin wrapper library of [libsoundio] for the Unity C# runtime
environment.

[libsoundio]: https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio

At the moment, the audio input features are only implemented and tested because
the main aim of this project is providing low-latency audio input functionality
to Unity.

libsoundio binaries contained in this repository are slightly different from
the official ones. See the following fork for details.
