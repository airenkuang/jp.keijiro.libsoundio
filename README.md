=====================

This is a thin wrapper class library of [libsoundio] for the Unity C# runtime
environment.

[libsoundio]: https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio

At the moment, only the audio input features are implemented and tested because
the main aim of this project is providing low-latency audio input functionality
for Unity.

libsoundio binaries contained in this repository are slightly different from
the official ones. See the following fork for details:
